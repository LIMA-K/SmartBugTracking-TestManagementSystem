# 🐞 Smart Bug Tracking & Test Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Bug Tracking & Test Management System** is a web-based application designed to manage software bugs and testing activities efficiently.  
It helps **Admins, Testers, and Developers** collaborate on reporting, tracking, and resolving software defects in a structured manner.

This project supports **manual testing workflows** and is designed to be **extendable to automation testing** in the future.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Centralized platform for bug reporting and tracking
- Role-based access for Admin, Tester, and Developer
- Support test case management and execution
- Improve communication between testing and development teams
- Maintain bug lifecycle from creation to closure
- Scalable architecture for future automation integration

## 🚀 Proposed System
- Web-based centralized bug tracking system
- Role-based dashboards
- Structured test case management
- Real-time bug status updates
- Improved traceability and accountability
- Secure authentication and authorization
